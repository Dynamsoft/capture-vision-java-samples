## License

The library requires a license to work, you use the API initLicense to initialize license key and activate the SDK.

These samples use a free public trial license which require network connection to function. You can request a 30-day free trial license key from <a href="https://www.dynamsoft.com/customer/license/trialLicense?product=dcv&utm_source=samples&package=java" target="_blank">Customer Portal</a> which works offline.
